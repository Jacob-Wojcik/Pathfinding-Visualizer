# About 
We are developing a pathfinding visualizer, based on the project above:
https://github.com/0kzh/pathfinding-visualizer?tab=readme-ov-file

This application will allow analysis and observation of pathfinding using several different algorithms.

## Getting Started
### What you need
You will need to download Node.js and npm. Node.js is an open-source cross-platform, Javascript runtime enviroment. npm is the default package manager for Javascript's runtime Node.js

Learn more about Node.js and npm here:
- https://nodejs.org/en - official Node.js Docs
- https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-npm-a-node-package-manager-tutorial-for-beginners/ 
- https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm - installation guide


Once you have successfully downloaded Node.js and npm

### Clone the repository
Clone the remote repository in a folder on your local machine using: 
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/rKamindo/pathfinding-visualizer
```
Navigate to the folder where the repository was cloned.

### Running locally
First install all the dependencies of the project:
```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application running on your local machine
